# üìß Gmail API Setup Guide for Invoice Automation

## Overview

Your Invoice Automation app now supports **Gmail API integration** which allows you to send invoices directly from your Gmail account. This means:

- ‚úÖ **Sent folder sync**: All sent invoices appear in your Gmail Sent folder  
- ‚úÖ **Professional delivery**: Recipients see your real Gmail address
- ‚úÖ **Free quota**: 250 emails per day with standard Gmail
- ‚úÖ **No third-party**: Direct integration with Google's servers

2. If prompted, configure the consent screen first (see Step 4)
3. Choose **"Web application"**
4. Add your domain to **"Authorized JavaScript origins"**:
   - For local testing: `http://localhost:8080`
   - For production: `https://yourdomain.com`
5. Copy your Client ID (ends with `.apps.googleusercontent.com`)

### Step 4: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. Go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"OAuth consent screen"**
2. Choose **"External"** (unless you have a Google Workspace)
3. Fill in the required information:

4. Click **"üíæ Save Configuration"**
5. Click **"üîê Test Sign-In"** and authorize the app
6. You're ready to send emails!

## How It Works

### First Time Setup:
1. App opens Google sign-in popup
2. You authorize the app to send emails on your behalf
3. Google provides secure access token
4. App can now send emails directly through Gmail

### Sending Invoices:
1. Click **"üìß Send Email"** on any saved invoice
2. App automatically composes professional email
3. Email is sent directly from your Gmail account
4. Copy appears in your Gmail Sent folder
5. Client receives email from your actual Gmail address

### Security:
- **OAuth 2.0**: Industry-standard secure authentication
- **Limited scope**: App can only send emails, not read them
- **Your control**: You can revoke access anytime in Google Account settings
- **No passwords**: App never sees your Gmail password

## Troubleshooting

### "Sign-in failed" or "Authorization error"
- Make sure your domain is in "Authorized JavaScript origins"
- For local testing, use `http://localhost` not `127.0.0.1`
- Check that Gmail API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Verify your OAuth consent screen is configured

### "API key not valid"
- Make sure API key is unrestricted or restricted to Gmail API only
- Check that the key wasn't accidentally deleted from Google Cloud
- Try creating a new API key

### "Access blocked" or "App not verified"
- This is normal during development with "External" consent screen
- Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to Invoice Automation (unsafe)" to proceed
- For production, submit app for verification (optional)

### "Daily quota exceeded"
- Gmail API has daily quotas (usually very high)
- Check your quota usage in Google Cloud Console
- Most users never hit these limits with normal invoice sending

## Advanced Configuration

### Production Deployment:
1. Update "Authorized JavaScript origins" with your live domain
2. Consider verifying your app for higher quotas
3. Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console

### Custom Email Templates:
The app automatically generates professional emails, but you can customize the templates by modifying the `generateInvoiceEmailBody` function in `gmail-api.js`.

### Bulk Email Sending:
For bulk operations, be mindful of Gmail's sending limits:
- **250 messages/day** for standard Gmail
- **2000 messages/day** for Google Workspace

## Alternative Setup Options

If Gmail API setup seems complex, the app also supports:

1. **üìã Copy & Paste**: Copy email content to any email client
2. **üì± Social Sharing**: Share via WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS
3. **üì¨ Basic Gmail**: Open Gmail compose window (manual sending)
4. **üìé PDF Email**: Download PDF and attach manually
