# PDF Export Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Fixed: "Error exporting PDF"

### ‚úÖ **What was fixed:**

1. **Missing collectInvoiceData method** - This method was being called but not defined
2. **Incorrect field IDs** - Updated to match actual form field IDs
3. **Business information loading** - Now properly loads from localStorage settings
4. **Invoice number generation** - Auto-generates if empty
5. **Default data handling** - Provides fallback data if forms are incomplete
6. **Enhanced error logging** - More detailed console messages for debugging

### üîß **Current Status:**

- ‚úÖ PDF Export functionality fully implemented
- ‚úÖ Collects data from actual form fields
- ‚úÖ Generates professional PDF with styling
- ‚úÖ Auto-generates invoice numbers
- ‚úÖ Loads business info from settings
- ‚úÖ Provides fallback data for incomplete forms

### üß™ **How to test:**

1. **Open the application** - Navigate to Invoice Builder
2. **Invoice will auto-populate** with:
   - Generated invoice number (INV-XXXXXX)
   - Default due date (30 days from today)
   - Default line item
   - Business info from settings (or defaults)

3. **Customize as needed**:
   - Edit client information
   - Add/modify line items
   - Add shipping costs
   - Add notes

4. **Click "Export PDF"**:
   - Should generate and download PDF immediately
   - Check browser console for detailed logs
   - Success message should appear

### üîç **If still having issues:**

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for error messages
2. **Verify html2pdf library loaded** - Should see it in Network tab
3. **Check localStorage** - Settings should be saved
4. **Try with minimal data** - Just default values should work

### üìã **Test Scenarios:**

1. **Minimal test**: Use all default values, just click Export PDF
2. **Full test**: Fill in all fields and export
3. **Empty forms**: Try with completely empty forms (should use defaults)
4. **Custom client**: Select a saved client and export

### üõ† **Technical Details:**

The `collectInvoiceData()` method now:
- Uses correct field IDs (`shipping-cost`, `invoice-notes`, etc.)
- Loads business settings from localStorage
- Creates default settings if none exist  
- Handles missing client selection gracefully
- Provides fallback data for all required fields
- Auto-generates invoice numbers
- Validates and sanitizes input data

The PDF should now export successfully with professional formatting!
