# Email Setup Guide for Invoice Automation

Your invoice app supports multiple ways to actually send emails to clients. Here are your options:

## Option 1: EmailJS (Recommended - Free tier available)

EmailJS allows you to send emails directly from your website without a backend.

### Setup Steps:
1. Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create a free account
3. Connect your email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Create an email template
5. Add the EmailJS script to your app
6. Configure your service ID, template ID, and user ID

### Add to index.html:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@3/dist/email.min.js"></script>
<script>
(function(){
    emailjs.init("YOUR_USER_ID"); // Replace with your EmailJS user ID
})();
</script>
```

## Option 2: Formspree (Easy setup)

Formspree handles form submissions and can forward emails.

### Setup Steps:
1. Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new form
4. Copy your form endpoint
5. Update the endpoint in advanced-email.js

## Option 3: Web Share API (Mobile/Desktop)

Uses the device's native sharing capabilities.

### Features:
- Works on mobile devices
- Can share via any installed app
- No additional setup required

## Option 4: Copy to Clipboard

Copies the email content so you can paste it into any email client.

### Features:
- Works everywhere
- No setup required
- Complete control over sending

## Option 5: Social Sharing

Create shareable links for WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, etc.

### Features:

## Current Implementation

Your app currently uses the `mailto:` protocol which opens the default email client. This is the most compatible option but requires manual sending.

To upgrade to automatic sending, choose one of the options above and follow the setup instructions.

- ✅ Actually sends emails automatically
